To build:

	(1) Modify THRIFT_BASE and CASSANDRA in the Makefile to reflect where
	    you have those things installed.

	(2) Type "make"

To run:

	(1) Make sure Cassandra is running locally.

	(2) Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include libcassfs.so and any other relevant
	    libraries (e.g. thrift).

	(3) Use the CLI to build an empty filesystem

	(4) Run the FUSE daemon to mount the filesystem.

	For example:

		# In your Cassandra directory...
		bin/cassandra -f

		# In this directory...
		export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/thrift/lib:.
		echo "mkfs foo" | ./cassfs_cli
		mkdir -p /tmp/myfs
		./cassfs -f -s -o name=foo /tmp/myfs

Notes:

	The thrift_gen directory contains files generated by Thrift from the
	Cassandra source.  You should probably re-generate those files with
	your version of both.
